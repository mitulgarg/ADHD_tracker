# ADHD_tracker

This is a program made for students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD
The OpenCV module accesses the front camera and detects excessive physical movement, thus showing lack of sitting and paying attention while doing a particular task.
The timestamps of movement are recorded and updated in an excel database 'Time_of_movements.csv' .
This data is finally plotted and used for knowledge purposes, to know when and at which points and how often 
was the ADHD student paying attention while doing his work and not moving around.
The future of this project includes, giving good promptds to the student to breathe, calm down and focus.
This is also used as a doctors dataset, and medication and knowledge of movement can therefore be plotted and analyzed.
